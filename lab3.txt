BucketsNumber is a number that will decide how many buckets will be found in the list.

Each bucket is a deque.

search(element) -> checks if there is an existing element with this value.
                -> if the element already exists, it will return the pair (hashValue, index)
                   where hashValue is the hash computed for that element and index is the position in that deque.
                -> if no element exists, it will return (-1, -1)


addElement(element):
        -> checks if the element already exists: if it exists, it will return its position from the search method.
        -> if this element doesn't exist, it will append the element at the end of the bucket.
